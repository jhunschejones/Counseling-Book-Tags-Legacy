# Counseling Book Tags

## Overview
Counseling Book Tags is a web application that allows users to access information from a public book API, coupled with custom user-defined tags and comments that describe different counseling topics displayed in each tagged book. The application is built using Node.js and Express along with a MongoDB database.

## Building Process

This application was built using an API-first approach and an MVC architecture patter *(where possible)*. This meant first planning out the structure of the API before building the rest of the application around this initial structure. Another key element of this type of design is clear API documentation. I intentionally constructed a JSON response at the `/api/v1` that describes for a user *(or developer)* exactly what endpoints are available, their uses, and some expected response structures. Designing an API before the UI is also helpful because it enables me to be intentional about the data I am returning, no more or less than will be needed. This helps consumption of these API endpoints to be easier later on in the development process, and as the application grows in the future. Finally, through the process of modifying data being returned by external API's, I have created a separation between my application and the data structure of any 3rd party API's it is consuming. If an external API's data structure changes, I will only need to make updates in one spot in the API layer of my application, rather than throughout my front and back end.
