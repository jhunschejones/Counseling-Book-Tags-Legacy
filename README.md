# Counseling Book Tags

## Overview
Counseling Book Tags is a web application that allows users to access information from a public book API, coupled with custom user-defined tags and comments that describe different counseling topics displayed in each tagged book. The application is built using Node.js and Express along with a MongoDB database.

## Building Process

This application was built using an API-first approach and an MVC architecture patter *(where possible)*. This meant first planning out the structure of the API before building the rest of the application around this initial structure. Another key element of this type of design is clear API documentation. I intentionally constructed a JSON response at the `/api/v1` that describes for a user *(or developer)* exactly what endpoints are available, their uses, and some expected response structures. Designing an API before the UI is also helpful because it enables me to be intentional about the data I am returning, no more or less than will be needed. This helps consumption of these API endpoints to be easier later on in the development process, and as the application grows in the future. Finally, through the process of modifying data being returned by external API's, I have created a separation between my application and the data structure of any 3rd party API's it is consuming. If an external API's data structure changes, I will only need to make updates in one spot in the API layer of my application, rather than throughout my front and back end.

On the front end, I am working to achieve the project requirements without adding too many extra features. The home page pulls all the tags from the database and displays them as pill-badges. After this initial database call, no further database calls are required as long as the user is navigating around the home page. *(This improves performance on the front end and lightens the load on the database.)* The page then allows the user to select by alphabet letter, or "all tags", then filter the tags on the page with an input field. The page uses session storage to remember which selection the user made, and a column layout so that it can break down usably on a mobile screen. Finally, each tag sends the user to the search page with the tag text as the value. Long tag text is cut down at a full word break and an ellipse is added to keep the page clean. I was also careful to construct all buttons with event listeners instead of `onclick` functions so that the page will fully function in Firefox.
